# Welcome to Heaven Listeners
This is my last 3WA project, a music library.

# How to access and start from the 3WA IDE, with 2 command terminals :

Front terminal :
    - cd sites/final_project/heaven_listeners/client
    - npm run dev
    
Back terminal : 
    - cd sites/final_project/heaven_listeners/server
    - npm start

# If you are using another IDE, with 2 command terminals :

Front terminal :
    - cd client
    - npm run dev
    
Back terminal : 
    - cd server
    - npm start
    
You can find in the data folder :
    - database.sql
    - MCD and MPD schemas
    
Thanks for reading !
